# Traffic-Prediction
**Project Title:** Traffic Data Analysis and Prediction Using Data Science and Machine Learning

**Description:**
Traffic congestion is a persistent issue in growing urban areas, leading to wasted time, increased pollution, and heightened accident risks. This project was initiated to understand and predict traffic patterns using real-world traffic data combined with machine learning techniques. The aim was not only to analyze traffic behavior but also to build a model that could forecast future congestion levels and accident likelihood based on key variables.

I started by performing detailed data analysis on traffic flow, vehicle counts, accident history, weather conditions, time of day, and road types. This helped uncover critical patterns such as peak hours, high-risk zones, and weather-related disruptions. Data visualization and statistical methods revealed insights like increased congestion during weekdays and higher accident rates during low visibility conditions.

To move beyond analysis, I trained machine learning models that could predict traffic volume and potential accident hotspots. Features such as time, location, weather, and historical traffic trends were used as input. These models aimed to assist in proactive traffic managementâ€”helping city planners and traffic control systems anticipate congestion before it happens.

This predictive approach has real-world value: it can be used in intelligent transport systems, GPS applications for real-time route suggestions, or to support infrastructure planning decisions. The project demonstrates how combining data analysis with machine learning can lead to smarter cities, reduced traffic impact, and safer roads.
